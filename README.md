# What is this?
This is a collection of summaries for all the VRC developer streams, people are welcome to expand it if they wish.

None of this is official, but if possible I wan't to keep it purely using content from the streams themselves, perhaps with small intros to the clips.

## Where is it?
Currently the only dev log summary is [here](/VRChatDevStreamSummary/2021_04_14)

## Stylists needed!
If you want to contribute, this website is in desperate need of some decent CSS, feel free to leave a PR and make it better
